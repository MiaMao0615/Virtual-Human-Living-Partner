# Virtual Human as Living Partner: Mobile Augmented Reality Companion

This repository contains the code and assets for the **Virtual Human as Living Partner** project, a mobile augmented reality (AR) system that brings a virtual human into the user's physical environment. Through timeline-based state scheduling and by aligning the camera to pre-calibrated markers, the system dynamically instantiates, animates, and locates the virtual human in real space. The goal is to transform this agent into a living companion that provides continuous presence, context-aware behavior, and interactive companionship. For a specific demo, please refer to the **Virtual Human as Living Partner.mp4** file in the project.
